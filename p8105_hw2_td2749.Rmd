# Problem 2: Mr. Trash Wheel

```{r Reading in the Mr. Trash Wheel Excel Sheet}

#The original excel sheet consists of 533 rows and 17 columns. Upon examination of the entire 'Mr. Trash Wheel' sheet, I have realized that NA cells in the 'Dumpster' column and the final 'Grand Total' row could be used to remove the associated rows in the process of creating a tidy/analysis-friendly sheet. By setting up a range, I have also excluded the last 3 columns as they contain only notes. 

mr_trash_wheel = 
  readxl::read_excel("data/t_w.xlsx", sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel", range = "A2:N535", na = c("", "Grand Total")) %>%
  drop_na(Dumpster) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  

view(mr_trash_wheel)
```
