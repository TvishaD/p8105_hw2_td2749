# Problem 2: Trash Wheel

``` r
#The original excel sheet consists of 533 rows and 17 columns. Upon examination of the entire 'Mr. Trash Wheel' sheet, I have realized that NA cells in the 'Dumpster' column be used to remove the associated rows in the process of creating a tidy/analysis-friendly sheet. By setting up a range, I have excluded the last 3 columns as they contain only notes and also the last two rows (containing totals figures). The resultant sheet has 453 dumpster-specific rows and 14 columns. 

mr_trash_wheel = 
  readxl::read_excel("data/t_w.xlsx", sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel", range = "A2:N533", na = "") %>%
  drop_na(Dumpster) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  rename(weight = weight_tons, volume = volume_cubic_yards) %>%
  mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(round(sports_balls)))

mr_trash_wheel = mutate(mr_trash_wheel, identifier = rep("*", nrow(mr_trash_wheel)))
```

``` r
prof_trash_wheel = 
  readxl::read_excel("data/t_w.xlsx", sheet = "Professor Trash Wheel", range = "A2:N115", na = "") %>%
  drop_na(Dumpster) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  rename(weight = weight_tons, volume = volume_cubic_yards) %>%
  mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(round(sports_balls)))

prof_trash_wheel = mutate(prof_trash_wheel, identifier = rep("#", nrow(prof_trash_wheel)))
```

``` r
trash_wheel_collective = 
  bind_rows(mr_trash_wheel, prof_trash_wheel) #Ask about not specifying anything about stacking criteria here. 
```

Write a paragraph about these data; you are encouraged to use inline R.
Be sure to note the number of observations in the resulting dataset, and
give examples of key variables. For available data, what was the total
weight of trash collected by Professor Trash Wheel? What was the total
number of sports balls collected by Mr. Trash Wheel in 2020?

The final dataset `trash_wheel_collective` consists of *524
observations* ranging across *15 columns*. 453 of the observations
pertain to unique dumpsters associated with Mr. Trash Wheel. The
remaining 71 observations pertain to the unique dumpsters associated
with Professor Trash Wheel. The column names are: `dumpster` (unique
dumpster number), `month`,`year`, and `date` of trash collection,
`weight` of trash collected in *tons*, `volume` of trash collected in
*cubic yards*, `plastic_bottles` (number?), `polystyrene` (presumably
number of items), `cigarette_butts`, `glass_bottles`, `grocery_bags`,
`chips_bags`, and `sports_balls` all in numbers, `homes_powered` from
the energy generated through trash conversion, and a final `identifier`
column for easy distinction between the Mr. Trash Wheel and Professor
Trash Wheel data.

-   The total weight of trash collected by Professor Trash Wheel was:
    135.5 tons.
-   The total number of sports balls collected by Mr. Trash Wheel in
    2020 was: 5321

*Is there a better way to do the above? What are the different ways?*
